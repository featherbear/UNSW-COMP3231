# The OS/161 Kit

* OS/161
* System/161
* Development Tools

## OS/161

OS/161 is the kernel and software suite that is developed on for this course.

## System/161

System/161 is a simulated MIPS system that the OS/161 operating system runs on. It emulates a MIPS R2000/R3000 CPU.

## Development Tools

* `bmake` - `make` for os161
* `os161-gcc` - Compiles files to a MIPS binary format
* `os161-*` - Other OS/161 related tools

# Installation

<s>At the time of writing this (February 19th 5:35PM), the course's personal development environment install guide wasn't accessible.</s> EDIT: Nevermind, I had to log in... aha....

0) Create support directory

```
mkdir -p ~/cs3231/root
```

1) Install the build toolchain  

We need a few things to compile the software.  
What you may need will depend on what you already have on your machine.

## OS/161 Utilities

These contain the `os161-` prefixed compiler tools

File: [os161-utils_2.0.8.deb](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs3231/os161-files/os161-utils_2.0.8.deb)

```bash
andrew ::  sudo dpkg -i os161-utils_2.0.8.deb 
          Selecting previously unselected package os161-utils.

## os161-gdb

Create shortcut `.gdbinit` file

```
cat > ~/cs3231/root/.gdbinit << :EOF
set can-use-hw-watchpoints 0
define connect
dir ~/cs3231/asst0-src/kern/compile/ASST0
target remote unix:.sockets/gdb
b panic
end
:EOF

echo "set auto-load safe-path /" >> ~/.gdbinit
```

## libmpfr4

Getting this error during compilation?  
**error while loading shared libraries: libmpfr.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory**

> _MPFR provides a library for multiple-precision floating-point computation with correct rounding. The computation is both efficient and has a well-defined semantics. It copies the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic (53-bit mantissa)._ 

My Ubuntu 19.10 installation doesn't have the `libmpfr4` package available in its APT repository anymore, so I had to make a dirty hack to link the somewhat-backwards-compatible newer version to the old version.

`sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpfr.so.6 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpfr.so.4`

// TODO Make better?

## bmake

`sudo apt install bmake`

## ncurses

`sudo apt install libncurses5`

2) Get the source code  

```
cd ~/cs3231
git clone https://z8888888@gitlab.cse.unsw.EDU.AU/COMP3231/20T1/z8888888-asst0.git asst0-src
```

(Replacing 8888888 with your zID)

3) Configure

```
cd asst0-src
./configure
```

4) (B)Make

```
bmake
```

5) Install  

```
bmake install
```

6) Build the OS/161 Kernel

```
cd ~/cs3231/asst0-src/kern/conf
./config ASST0

cd ../compile/ASST0
bmake depend
bmake
bmake install
```

7) Create a rebuild script

```
cat > ~/cs3231/asst0-src/rebuild.sh << :EOF
#!/bin/bash
cd "$(dirname "$0")"
cd kern/compile/ASST0
echo "Building..."
bmake && bmake install
:EOF

chmod a+x rebuild.sh
```

Now we can rebuild easily with `./rebuild`!
